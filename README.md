# DifferentialEquations
This project is a part of PSI2023 Numerical Method course coordinate by Eric and Dustin. This code works on Julia 1.8.5 `(lastest updated 03/16/23)`.

We will investigate in the following: solving wave equation, stability limit, energy density of a scalar wave, and total energy.
